# Brownian motion demonstration using Monte Carlo simulation
A sequence of random numbers can be a very simple Monte Carlo simulation. For instance, a list of random numbers generated independently from a normal distribution with mean 0 can simulate a white noise process.

Unlike everwhere in the internet, I've used random numbers using a normal distribution for both x and y coordinates of the particle which are successively sumed with other points to give a path. I tried interpolating among the points but the results were not so impressive as this one. Both 2D and 3D versions available now!
